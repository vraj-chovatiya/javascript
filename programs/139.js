//BASIC THEORY 

// AJAX : asyncronous javascript and XML

// is a set of "web development techniques"
// using many web technologies on the "client-side"
// to create asynchronous web applications.

// with Ajax, web application can send and retrieve 
// data from a server asynchronous (in the background)
// without interfacing with the display and 
// behaviour of the existing page

// we don't use data in XML formal anymore.
// we use JSON now.

// we have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server
// 1). xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing)
// 2). fetch API (new way of doing)
// 3). axios (this is third party library)
